## Project - Hidden Makrov Model
  Neural network architectures
1. Set up a new git repository in your GitHub account
2. Pick two datasets from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine-learning_research
3. Choose a programming language (Python, C/C++, Java)
4. Formulate ideas on how neural networks can be used to accomplish the task for the specific dataset
5. Build a neural network to model the prediction process programmatically
6. Document your process and results
7. Commit your source code, documentation and other supporting files to the git repository in GitHub
